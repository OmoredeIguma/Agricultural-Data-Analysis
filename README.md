# Overview
This project explores a crop yield dataset provided on [Kaggle by Samuel Oti Attakorah](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield). This dataset provides a comprehensive view aimed at predicting crop yield (in tonnes per hectare) based on several factors. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique crop with its unique profile, such as the region where it was grown, the soil type, the amount of rainfall, etc, offering a detailed breakdown of how these factors could affect yield. The dataset originally consisted of 1 million rows, but was scaled down to 500 due to technical limitations such as lags and crashes. <br />

The transformed dataset and the raw SPSS output file are presented above along with the results and discussions in a Word document presented in APA 7th edition format which goes in-depth into the findings. Below this readme file is a quick summary of findings and recommendations based on the results obtained from the dataset.<br />

# Data Preparation
The variables Region, Soil Type, Crop, Fertiliser Used, Irrigation Used, and Weather, were recoded automatically using SPSS built-in automatic recode function. The decimals for the scale variables were reduced to 2 decimal places. No duplicates or missing values were found in the dataset.

# Objectives
Objective 1: Descriptive statistics for Region, Soil Type, Crop, Fertiliser used?, Irrigation Used?, Rainfall, Temperature, Days to Harvest, Yield per hectares and Weather Condition. This was achieved using frequency count, mean, and percentages. <br />

Objective 2: Effect of Fertiliser used on Yield per hectare. This was achieved using an independent samples t-test to compare the average yield between whether fertiliser was applied or not. <br />

Objective 3: Effect of irrigation used on Yield per hectare. This was achieved using an independent samples t-test to compare the average yield between whether irrigation was applied or not. <br />

Objective 4: Correlations. This was achieved using Pearson's correlation to examine the relationship between Rainfall, Temperature, Days to Harvest and Yield per hectare(tonnes). <br />

Objective 5: Factors influencing crop yield. This was achieved using multiple linear regression analysis to determine if rainfall, temperature, days to harvest, fertiliser used and soil type have an effect on overall yield. <br />

Objective 6: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). This was conducted to examine if total yield differs from one region to the other. <br />
