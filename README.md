# Overview
This project explores a crop yield dataset provided on [Kaggle by Samuel Oti Attakorah](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield). This dataset provides a comprehensive view aimed at predicting crop yield (in tonnes per hectare) based on several factors. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique crop with its unique profile, such as the region where it was grown, the soil type, the amount of rainfall, etc, offering a detailed breakdown of how these factors could affect yield. The dataset originally consisted of 1 million rows, but was scaled down to 500 due to technical limitations such as lags and crashes. <br />

The transformed dataset and the raw SPSS output file are presented above along with the results and discussions in a Word document presented in APA 7th edition format which goes in-depth into the findings. Below this readme file is a quick summary of findings and recommendations based on the results obtained from the dataset.<br />
